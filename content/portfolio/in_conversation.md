**Project**: Make it possible for tech entrepreneurs to share their stories in their own words, then make that content widely available for free learning.

**People**: Leadership of Women 2.0, an organization that works to increase the number of women starting high-growth technical ventures; up-and-coming and seasoned entrepreneurs.

![women2.0 In Conversation][1]

My interest in technical equity was sparked by the discovery that less than 5% of entrepreneurs in the technology industry are women. Can’t be, I remember thinking. 

I joined Women 2.0 as an events production volunteer and suggested that we might use multimedia to reach more geographically diverse prospective founders. 

To encourage this entrepreneurship, I began producing “In Conversation,” a Women 2.0 video interview series that invites female CEOs and company co-founders to share their product development and startup growth advice. I’ve interviewed entrepreneurs as diverse as the creator of the world’s first major photo-sharing platform, a taxi-hailing app developer, and a publisher of books that consumers create themselves. Two years, 40 video interviews, and 50,000 video views since starting the series, I want to use it to show people what they, too, can create through collaborative technologies.

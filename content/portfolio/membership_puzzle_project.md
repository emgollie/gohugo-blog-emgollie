**Project**: [An initiative](https://membershippuzzle.org/) to study how news organizations are diversifying their revenue, optimizing for trust, and encouraging members to participate in their journalism.

**People**: NYU Journalism School's Jay Rosen in partnership with the Dutch journalism platform [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/). Our work is funded by Democracy Fund and the Knight Foundation. 

![The Membership Puzzle Project][1]

With decreases in funding for news organizations and crises in public trust, we need to create sustainable paths forward that are more inclusive of audience needs. Membership is one approach to revenue generation and public inclusion and has yet to be comprehensively studied. As research director for [The Membership Puzzle Project](https://membershippuzzle.org/), I lead a global team of designers and researchers working to create knowledge products and design principles for the news industry. 

We're developing open source tools and actively publishing insights in these areas:

+ [Hackable guides](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/2017/4/4/hack-our-user-research-material) for news sites' own research into their supporters' concerns;
+ Interviews with media organizations and members around the world to understand the social contract: what each gives and gets;
+ [Analogous research](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/behavior-first-rules-second) into domains beyond news as they inform membership program planning within media;
+ A [public database](https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/introducing-the-database) of membership models within news, the first such offering for program understanding and ideation.
